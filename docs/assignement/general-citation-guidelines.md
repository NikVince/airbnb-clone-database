## 1. INTRODUCTION

Writing effectively in an academic setting is an important skill on the path to study success. For this reason, it's important to follow the basic principles of academic work and academic writing. This includes effectively searching for, evaluating and managing sources, which form the foundation for your writing. This also includes correctly citing and referencing your sources according to a recognized academic standard.

Properly using a citation style is a basic principle of academic integrity. According to the German Research Foundation (DFG), academic integrity is the basis of credible science and good academic practice. The principle of academic integrity aims to protect and preserve the reputation and the image of academia and academic institutions. When you begin your own study programme you also accept the responsibility to uphold this principle. In practical terms that means that you should consider the sources that you use for your research projects as the intellectual property of their authors. You should clearly indicate these sources in a way that makes it easy for others to find them. The International Centre for Academic Integrity defines the following six values as the basis for academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage.

Academic work and academic writing at the IU International University means that you critically evaluate the knowledge base in your study area. In this process you also use academic methods and procedures to assemble your written work, which should ultimately add to your own knowledge and to that of the discipline. As you are building on knowledge developed by others, your own work should always be placed in the context of existing scientific and practice-related findings by correctly citing and referencing them.

These guidelines should ensure that you will be able to properly and confidently follow the rules of proper citation and referencing. These guidelines apply for the whole IU International University. During your studies with us we generally encourage you to use APA (American Psychological Association) style, with consideration of the exceptions outlined in this document.

These guidelines explain how you should follow one consistent style to refer to sources in your text and prepare a list of references. Be aware that in some modules there may be alternative guidelines that you can use in addition to the ones in this document.

## 2. CITING IN APA STYLE

The APA regularly updates its citation style. The current version is the 7th Edition, which you can use when writing academic papers in English. Any deviations from the APA citation guidelines have been explicitly mentioned in this document. Further formal requirements (e.g. regarding line spacing) are specified in the respective examination guidelines.

These guidelines explain how to cite the most common types of sources. If you need more examples or explanations for citations according to the 7th edition, visit the official APA website at https://apastyle.apa.org/.

**Course books, lecture slides, webinars etc. cannot be used as sources in your assignments.**

The same rules apply to presentations (e.g. using PowerPoint or Prezi) as for written work. All direct or paraphrased use of other sources must be referenced on the individual slides according to the rules. This also applies to all visuals, images or tables. Use the rules (see section 2.1) for in-text citations and provide the full reference list at the end of the presentation. There are no rules on where exactly to place the sources on the slides.

### 2.1 In-Text Citations in APA

In general, you must acknowledge the use of the intellectual property of others (words or ideas). In all of your assignments, you must indicate each source and its location. The reader must be able to check each of your sources and easily follow them to their location.

Within the text, citations are written in an abbreviated form (in-text citations). When using a direct quote or paraphrasing text, always include the last name of the author(s), the year of publication and the page number¹. In some types of sources, no page number is available. For an audio book, provide a time stamp, or for an eBook in EPUB format, mention the chapter. In paraphrases that do not refer to a particular spot in a text, only the last name of the author(s) and the year of publication are provided.

The author must always be cited in an in-text citation and listed under the same name in the reference list. If a citation refers to two or more pages (e.g. pages 24 and 25), then the first and the last page of the source should be cited with a hyphen (e.g. pp. 24–25). If a citation refers to several individual pages in the source, then these should all be stated separated by a comma (e.g., p. 12, 34).

To maintain the flow of the text, you can use footnotes to indicate your side notes or explanations that are not immediately relevant to the text. Footnotes are also appropriate for translations of quotations from languages other than English or references to copyright. Footnotes are found at the bottom of the relevant page after the last period. They are indicated with a superscript in the text and are numbered throughout the whole text. Start the first word in a footnote with a capital letter, and end it with a period. You should not have long, complex footnotes (especially mathematical proofs or derivations). If you cannot integrate these into the text, include them as an appendix to the text. A dedicated footnote page at the end of your text is not necessary.

Generally, you should avoid citing sources that are themselves cited in a source (secondary sources). Always try to find the original source. If you cannot access the original source, however, citing a secondary source is acceptable. Cite the original source, then add "as cited in", then cite the secondary source. Include only the secondary source in the reference list.

**Structure in brackets:** (Author last name, year of publication, p. ??)  
**Two authors:** (Author last name & author last name, year of publication, p. ??)  
**Three or more authors:** (Author last name et al., year of publication, p. ??)

#### 2.1.1 Quotations in APA

You can use word-for-word (direct) quotations when the specific phrasing is unique or important for your text. However, to keep your own voice in your writing, do not string too many quotations together. As a general rule, limit the number of quotations in your text. This ensures that the text is your writing and really "yours".

**Short Quotations:**

Quotations of up to 40 words are incorporated into the text with quotation marks.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Citation from a secondary source** | Cultural tourists can be divided into two groups: specific cultural tourists and general cultural tourists (Irish Tourist Board, 1988, as cited in Steinecke, 2007, pp. 12–13). |
| **Quotation of a complete sentence** | "There is in fact evidence that changes in social practices, and even changes in temporary states of social orientation, can change the way people perceive and think" (Nisbett, 2003, p. 226). |
| **Quotation at the start of a sentence** | "Changes in social practices, and even changes in temporary states of social orientation" influence the way people see and think about the world, according to Nisbett (2003, p. 226). |
| **Quotation in the middle of the sentence** | Nisbett (2003) writes that "changes in social practices, and even changes in temporary states of social orientation" have an impact on perception and thinking (p. 226).<br><br>or<br><br>Nisbett (2003, p. 226) explains that "changes in social practices, and even changes in temporary states of social orientation" have an impact on perception and thinking. |
| **Quotation split into parts** | "Changes in social practices, and even changes in temporary states of social orientation" have a significant impact, argues Nisbett (2003), and "can change the way people perceive and think" (p. 226).<br><br>or<br><br>"Changes in social practices, and even changes in temporary states of social orientation" have a significant impact, argues Nisbett (2003, p. 226), and "can change the way people perceive and think". |

**Long Quotations (Over 40 Words)**

If the quotation is longer than 40 words, you should format it as an indented (1.27cm/0.5 inch) paragraph from the left. There are a few other rules:

- Do not use quotation marks.
- Begin the quotation with a capital letter and finish with a period, then follow with the page number in brackets.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Long direct quotation** | Flores et al. (2018) described how they addressed potential researcher bias when working with an intersectional community of transgender people of color:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone on the research team belonged to a stigmatized group but also held privileged identities. Throughout the research process, we attended to the ways in which our privileged and oppressed identities may have influenced the research process, findings, and presentation of results. (p. 311)<br><br>or<br><br>Flores et al. (2018, p. 311) described how they addressed potential researcher bias when working with an intersectional community of transgender people of color:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone on the research team belonged to a stigmatized group but also held privileged identities. Throughout the research process, we attended to the ways in which our privileged and oppressed identities may have influenced the research process, findings, and presentation of results.<br><br>or<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone on the research team belonged to a stigmatized group but also held privileged identities. Throughout the research process, we attended to the ways in which our privileged and oppressed identities may have influenced the research process, findings, and presentation of results. (Flores et al., p. 311) |

**Further Rules**

- Quotations should be exactly as written in the source. That means that you should also include any typos or grammatical errors, but you can indicate these with a [sic]. The first letter of the quotation can be changed to upper or lower case. The punctuation at the end of the quotation may be adjusted to suit the context.
- A quotation within a quotation is indicated with single quotation marks.
- If you leave out any word(s), indicate this with three periods. This does not apply if the quotation begins or ends in the middle of a sentence.
- Place additional comments by the author in square brackets if needed.
- If the quotation emphasizes certain words with italics or bold, but you chose to leave them out, indicate this directly after the quotation [emphasis removed]. When adding your own emphasis, you should also indicate this [emphasis added] directly after.
- Quotations in languages other than English are included as they are and translated in a footnote.
- When you need to remove a letter from a word in a direct quote, present the omitted letter in square brackets.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Quotation with a grammatical error** | Nowak (2019) wrote that "people have an obligation to care for there [sic] pets" (p. 52). |
| **Quotation with emphasis in original** | "The means being used are 'co-laboratory', and academics who receive funding define their research projects for themselves" (Halvorsen & Skare Orgeret, 2019, p. 1). |
| **Quotation with emphasis removed** | "The means [emphasis removed] being used are 'co-laboratory', and academics who receive funding define their research projects for themselves" (Halvorsen & Skare Orgeret, 2019, p. 1). |
| **Quotation with additional comments** | "However, the diverse demographics of tourists and the diversity of their motivations for travel – leisure, recreation, holidays, business meeting, conferences, scientific study, pilgrimage, health treatment – account for the complexity of the phenomenon [of tourism and tourists]" (Goodwin, 2016, p. 6). |
| **Quotation with several words left out** | "However, the diverse demographics of tourists and the diversity of their motivations for travel … account for the complexity of the phenomenon" (Goodwin, 2016, p. 6). |
| **Quotation with several words left out at beginning or at end of sentence** | "The diversity of their motivations for travel – leisure, recreation, holidays, business meeting, conferences, scientific study, pilgrimage, health treatment – account[s] for the complexity of the phenomenon" (Goodwin, 2016, p. 6). |
| **Quotation with added emphasis** | "However, the diverse demographics [emphasis added] of tourists and the diversity of their motivations for travel [emphasis added] – leisure, recreation, holidays, business meeting, conferences, scientific study, pilgrimage, health treatment – account for the complexity of the phenomenon" (Goodwin, 2016, p. 6). |

- Quotations from an audio book should be cited with a time stamp instead of a page number. The time stamp indicates the point at which the quotation begins.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Quotation from an audio book** | "There were no visible houses, and I could tell by the state of the road that traffic was very light hereabouts" (Lovecraft, 2011, 5:09). |

Quotations from an eBook in EPUB format that does not have stable page numbers are indicated with the chapter (abbreviated as "chap."). In the case of particularly long chapters, it is possible to refer to the paragraph (abbreviated as "para."). This rule can also be applied to citations from scientific journal articles which have been published as an advance online publication and do not yet have page numbers.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Quotation from an eBook in EPUB format** | "The primary objective of developing an autonomous vehicle is to reduce the number of accidents caused by humans" (Ng, 2021, chap. 1.1). |

---

#### 2.1.2 Paraphrases in APA

Paraphrasing means taking ideas from one or several sources and putting them into your own words. Do not use quotation marks when paraphrasing. A citation should also be provided for facts or figures that do not come from the literature, but are instead, for example, from your own research. The degree to which this paraphrase relates to your text should be clear.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Paraphrase** | Sustainably aware consumers in Germany prefer to take holidays in their own country (Klein, 2014, p. 261). |

In longer paraphrases of the same part of a source that extend over several sentences, the citation should be placed in the first sentence. If it is obvious that the paraphrase also continues in the following sentences, you do not have to include the citation again. This should improve the readability of the text. Care must be taken to ensure that it is obvious from the wording that the same source is used throughout. If you are not sure, if this is clear, it is possible to repeat the source within the same paragraph of text.

However, if the same part of the source is used again in a new paragraph, you need to mention the source again.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Longer paraphrase over two paragraphs: general example** | According to Müller (2022, p. 10), this is an example of the first paragraph in which several sentences refer to the same passage in a source. In the second sentence, which refers to the same passage, the source is not cited. Equally, the source is not mentioned in the third sentence either. In the fourth sentence, again, there is no citation. This insures readability. It is clear, however, that the entire paragraph is based on the same source.<br><br>This is another example from Müller (2022, p. 10) for the second paragraph, which introduces a new idea in the same source. Here, too, the source is only cited in the first sentence, but not in the second sentence. The source is not cited in the following sentences either as they all refer to the same source. |
| **Longer paraphrase over two paragraphs: concrete example** | Stern et al. (1999, pp. 82-83) distinguish between active and passive supporters in their value-belief norm theory (VBN theory). At the center of their theory are passive supporters, defined as "those who are sympathetic to the movement and who are willing to take some actions and bear some costs in order to support the movement." This identifies three forms of passive support for social movements: community engagement; willingness to make sacrifices; and environmentally friendly consumerism.<br><br>VBN theory from Stern et al. (1999, pp. 83) is based on the assumption that support for social movements is rooted in a combination of values, beliefs, and personal norms. Accordingly, it is understood as a causal chain of the following variables, which was tested in an empirical study: Values, Attitudes, Personal Norm in the Environmental Domain, Support for the Goals of the Environmental Movement.<br><br>Regarding values, the VBN theory from Stern et al. (1999, pp. 84) basically assumes three value orientations: egocentric, altruistic, and biocentric. These are measured by 26 items. |

#### 2.1.3 Miscellaneous Citation Rules in APA

**Multiple Authors**

If there are two authors, connect their names with an "and" in the text, or "&" if you're using brackets. If there are three authors or more, then provide just the name of the first author and continue with "et al.". If there are several sources from different groups of authors with the same first two authors published in the same year, you should provide as many names as necessary to differentiate the sources. The rest of the authors exceeding four authors are just indicated with "et al.".

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Two authors - Authors in the text** | According to Homburg and Krohmer (2011, p. 50), motivation and needs are closely related.<br><br>or<br><br>According to Homburg and Krohmer (2011), motivation and needs are closely related (p. 50). |
| **Two authors - Authors in brackets** | Motivation and needs are closely related (Homburg & Krohmer, 2011, p.50). |
| **Three authors or more - Authors in the text** | Meffert et al. (2008, p. 98) divide the marketing research process into four phases.<br><br>or<br><br>Meffert et al. (2008) divide the marketing research process into four phases (p.98). |
| **Three authors or more - Authors in brackets** | The marketing research process can be divided into four phases (Meffert et al., 2008, p. 98). |
| **Two or more sources with the same two first authors with the same publication year** | Complete list of authors in reference list:<br>Source 1: Kapoor, A., Bloom, B., Montez, C., Warner, D., & Hill, E. (2017)<br>Source 2: Kapoor, A., Bloom, B., Zucker, C., Tang, D., Köroğlu, E., L´Enfant, F., Kim, G., & Daly, H. (2017)<br><br>In-text citation:<br>Source 1: (Kapoor, Bloom, Montez et al., 2017, p. 13)<br>Source 2: (Kapoor, Bloom, Zucker et al., 2017, p. 22) |

**Citations of Several Sources**

If you are referring to several sources (for example, to support an argument), list them alphabetically and separate them with a semicolon. If you are referring to two or more sources from the same author, arrange them chronologically and separate the years with a comma. List the sources with unknown publication dates first.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Referring to several sources** | A growing number of studies examine the emotions of instructors while teaching (Frenzel, n.d., 2011, 2014; Frenzel et al., 2009; Hagenauer et al., 2015; Keller, 2014, 2016). |

**Several Sources by the Same Author(s) from the Same Year**

If you are citing several sources by the same author(s) from the same year, indicate this by adding the lowercase letters "a", "b", "c", … to the year. If the publication date is unknown, add the lowercase letters to "n.d." with a hyphen.

The in-text citation matches the name in the reference list; the allocation of the lowercase letters is based on the order of the publications in the reference list.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Examples of several sources by the same author from the same year** | (Schmude, 2014a, p. 40)<br>(Schmude, 2014b, p. 84)<br>(IU International University of Applied Sciences, n.d.-a)<br>(IU International University of Applied Sciences, n.d.-b) |

**Authors with the Same Last Name**

To avoid ambiguity, the first name initial should be used for different works by authors with the same last name. If several authors with the same last name have worked on the same work, the first name initials do not have to be mentioned.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Authors with the same last name** | The study conducted by A. Klein (2014) found that … |

**Authors with Special Last Names**

Last names which include articles or prepositions, such as "von", "van", "de" etc., pose a special challenge. These articles or prepositions are classified differently in common usage depending on the country and language, either as part of the family name or not. This results in different rules on how last names with these prefixes should be cited in the text, arranged alphabetically in the reference list, and capitalized. In Germany, the name prefix "von" is usually not classified as part of the last name. In the text and in the in-text citation, the last name would be mentioned without the "von".

However, for sake of ease, at IU we treat all last names with articles and prepositions as if the name prefixes were part of the last name. Capitalization and punctuation should be as preferred by the person themselves/how it is done in the source. An exception to this is where spelling requires a capital letter (e.g., beginning of a sentence).

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Authors with special last names** | (von Unger, 2014, p. 94) |
| **Authors in the text with special last names** | Counter arguments are presented by von Unger (2014, p. 94), …<br><br>Von Unger (2014, p. 94) argues that … |

**Citing Personal Communication**

Include personal (expert) interviews, notes from conversations, letters, emails, internal company documents not available to the public and other personal communication only in the text and not in the reference list. If you are quoting a person, ensure that they consent to this first.

**Unknown Date**

If you cannot identify the year of publication, use "n.d." (no date).

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Unknown publication date** | Ray und Anderson (n.d.) estimated the proportion of sustainably aware consumers in the USA in 2008 to be about a third. |

**Online Sources**

Online sources are cited exactly like books or journals: in the text you give an abbreviated citation and in the reference list the full one. The title or web address is not included in the citation. A general reference to a website does not need a citation or an entry in the reference list. Instead, provide the name of the site in brackets in the text.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Citation from an online source** | Following the fusion with the Adam Ries University of Applied Sciences in September 2013, the study programmes were offered under the IUBH Dual Studies Munich name (IUBH Internationale Hochschule GmbH, 2018). |
| **General reference to a webpage** | The survey was created using the Unipark (www.unipark.de) online survey tool. |

#### 2.1.4 Use of figures and tables²

**General information**

Figures (e.g. photos, clip art, images from an online database, diagrams) and tables must have the name of their content as a heading. The heading begins with the word "Fig." or "Tab." with the respective number and title of the figure or table.

The source is stated below the figure or table. This is done according to the following pattern:

```
Source: [if appropriate: information on the creation or origin]
        [If appropriate: citation of source in short citation form]
        [If appropriate: information on the type of license]
```

**Information on the creation or origin**

In the case of diagrams or tables, the source is indicated by a reference to their origin. These can be formulated as follows:

| Type | Formulation |
|------|-------------|
| **A self-created figure/table (e.g. with results of own survey or own photo)** | Own representation |
| **A recreated figure/table (without changes)** | Adapted from … |
| **A recreated figure/table (with changes)** | Adapted (with changes) from … |
| **A figure/table created by independent visualization of content/data from the cited source** | Own representation based on … |
| **A screenshot³ of a figure/table** | From … |
| **An AI-generated image** | Generated using the prompt "..." by |

The above is not applicable for photos, clip art, and images from an online database.

With regard to the labelling of AI-generated images, it should be noted that the handling of AI-supported applications is still under development. At the time of publication of the Citation Guidelines, there is still no standard procedure and, in particular, no official APA regulation. However, we recommend you use the citation method for other figures and tables and additionally indicate the prompt and programme used (see the table above for an example of the citation of an AI-generated image in the text below the figure, in chapter 2.2.6 there is an example of the citation in the reference list).

**Reference in short citation form**

For figures and tables that were not created by yourself a reference in short citation form is necessary. This follows the same citation rules that are used for the original source (e.g. a monograph, a chapter in an edited book, an online source, etc.).

For figures/tables that you have created yourself (e.g. showing the results of an own survey or an own photo), it is not necessary to add the source to the reference list. For all other figures/tables, an additional reference in the reference list is necessary. Here, the citation method depends on the type of the original source.

**Information on the type of license**

In the case of figures/tables that were not created by yourself you must check if and under which conditions you are permitted to use them.

When using images from an online database (e.g. Getty Images, Shutterstock or iStock), you must check whether they have been licensed under a Creative Commons license or are in the public domain. If this is not the case, an appropriate license must be purchased from the provider before use. Some online databases (for example, Pixabay) generally allow free commercial use and do not require any image credits. Even in such cases, a reference to the source is mandatory.

Most clipart does not require a reprint permission, but it may be necessary to indicate the type of license. For clipart that comes with programs such as Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, no reference to the source or information on the type of license is necessary.

When inserting a screenshot of figures/tables, permission to use them is usually required. If this is not available, the corresponding figure/table can be reproduced if necessary. An exception to this is the use of screenshots for the explanation or analysis of certain content – in this case, no indication of the type of license is necessary. This applies, for example, to the analysis of websites, social media presentation, or logos as part of a project or bachelor thesis. The requirement is that the screenshot does not serve to "embellish" the text, but is itself the subject of the analysis, so that an intellectual analysis of the content of the screenshot takes place.

### 2.2 Reference Lists

Any academic work must include a reference list at the end. This is the complete list of all the academic sources that you mentioned in your work as well as other materials that you have referred to.

The reference list provides a transparent list of the sources you used for the text. Your reader must be able to locate and check each source. To make this possible the following rules apply: accuracy (the source must be correct); completeness (provide enough information that makes it possible to find the source); consistency (use a particular format throughout); and clarity. List sources in alphabetical order by author, and chronologically by publication date in the case of several sources from one author. After the last name of the author, provide their initials and the year of publication in brackets. Space the list at 1.5 and align with the left margin; from the second line a reference is indented by 1.27cm. Beyond these rules the following also apply:

- Do not use dashes, hyphens or bullet points.
- The names of books, journals or newspapers are in italics.
- Titles of all works, such as books, articles and webpages are written in sentence case in the reference list, even if title case has been used in the original work.⁴ Use ":" to separate title and subtitle.
- If one author has several publications in one year, add a, b, c… after the year of publication.
- If an author appears several times in your reference list, work in chronological order.
- If you do not have a publication date, indicate this with "n.d." (no date).
- If there is no information about the volume or issue of a journal, leave this out altogether.
- Do not separate sources by types such as print, online, etc. All sources are in one list.
- All the authors in one source, should be written in the order listed in the source.
- Separate authors by a comma. From two to 20 authors include "&" before the last author.
- From 21 authors or more provide the first 19, then type "…", then the name of the last author.
- If a source is the first edition, you do not need to indicate the edition.
- Academic titles of authors or editors are not given. The last names of the authors are given as written in the work. To simplify different national and linguistic traditions, prefixed articles and prepositions such as "von", "van", and "de" may be considered part of the last name in assignments at IU, even if they usually are not. "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe" may accordingly be referred to in the reference list as "von Goethe, J. W." and sorted alphabetically under "v".⁵ The upper and lower case should be maintained.
- In the case of institutions as authors or editors, a period should be placed after the name of the institution (Institution. (year)). The name of an institution is not abbreviated in the reference list.
- Do not include series titles in the reference list.

**Particular Rules for Electronic resources from the Internet**

Electronic resources from the Internet can be monographs and edited books (in the form of eBooks), journal and newspaper articles, multimedia sources, as well as websites and PDF documents on websites. However, when citing, it is not the type of publication (print or digital) that matters, but the type of document. Only content from websites and PDF documents are categorized as Online sources in this guide. The citation of the electronic version of the other document types is explained in the respective section together with the indication of a printed version.

As a general rule, a DOI⁶ or URL should be indicated for electronic resources from the Internet. How this should be done depends on whether a DOI is available and whether the work is publicly accessible.

- If possible, provide the digital object identifier (DOI), irrespective of if the source is freely available or not.
- If there is no DOI, provide the URL instead for publicly accessible sources.
- If the source you accessed is not publicly accessible (e.g. you accessed it through a password-protected online database or eBook platform) and it does not have a DOI, do not provide the URL. Cite as you would for a print version.

Generally, if there is an electronic version and a printed version of a source available, cite the one you have been using. The in-text citation for electronic and printed versions of a source are the same.

#### 2.2.1 Monographs (printed and electronic versions)

A monograph is a book in which the individual chapters are related to each other. It can be written by one or more authors.

An electronic version of a monograph (or edited book) is called an eBook. If you are unsure whether a PDF file is an eBook, check whether it has an ISBN number and publisher information. If yes, it can be cited according to the rules for an eBook (i.e., appropriately as an electronic version of a monograph or edited book). If not, it is cited according to the rules for Online sources (see chapter 2.2.5).

**One author:** Last name, initials. (Year). *Title: Subtitle* (Edition [if later than the first edition]). Publisher. DOI or URL (depending on availability and accessibility)

**Two authors:** Last name, initials., & Last name, initials. (Year). *Title: Subtitle* (Edition [if later than the first edition]). Publisher. DOI or URL (depending on availability and accessibility)

**Three to twenty authors:** Last name, initials., Last name, initials., & Last name, initials. (Year). *Title: Subtitle* (Edition [if later than the first edition]). DOI or URL (depending on availability and accessibility)

**21 authors or more:** Last name, initials of the first author., Last name, initials of the second through nineteenth author., … Last name, initials of the last author. (Year). *Title. Subtitle* (Edition [if later than the first edition]). DOI or URL (depending on accessibility and availability)

#### 2.2.2 Edited Books (printed and electronic versions)

An edited book is a book containing contributions from different authors and published by one or more editors. A distinction is made between the editorship of the entire work and the authors of the individual chapters. If the title page explicitly mentions the editors, you can assume that it is an edited book.

An electronic version of an edited book (or monograph) is called an eBook. If you are unsure whether a PDF file is an eBook, check whether it has an ISBN number and publisher information. If it does, it can be cited according to the rules for an eBook (i.e., appropriately as an electronic version of an edited book or monograph). If not, it is cited according to the rules for Online sources (see chapter 2.2.5).

Indicate the authors at the beginning of the reference according to their number, in the same way as explained for monographs. Further down it is explained how the editors are referenced according to their number when citing a chapter from an edited book.

Conference proceedings are usually either published as a chapter in an edited book or as a journal article, with the book or journal consisting of all the proceedings from the conference.

**Chapter, one editor:** Last name, initials. (Year). Title of the chapter: Subtitle of the chapter. In initials. last name (Ed.), *Title of the edited book: Subtitle of the edited book* (Edition [if later than the first edition]), pp. ?–?). Publisher. DOI or URL (depending on availability and accessibility)

**Chapter, two editors:** Last name, initials. (Year). Title of the chapter: Subtitle of the chapter. In initials. last name & initials. last name (Eds.), *Title of the edited book: Subtitle of the edited book* (Edition [if later than the first edition]), pp. ?–?). Publisher. DOI or URL (depending on availability and accessibility)

**Chapter, three or more editors:** Last name, initials. (Year). Title of the chapter: Subtitle of the chapter. In initials. Last name, initials. Last name, & initials. Last name (Eds.), *Title of the edited book: Subtitle of the edited book* (Edition [if later than the first edition]), pp. ?–?). Publisher. DOI or URL (depending on availability and accessibility)

#### 2.2.4 Journal and Newspaper Articles (electronic and print versions)

In the case of journal articles and newspaper articles, page numbers in the reference list are given without the abbreviation "p.". For a newspaper article, the full date is given instead of the year.

If the article does not have a volume, issue, or page numbers (e.g., because it is an in-advance online publication of a journal article or an article from a newspaper's website), these elements are omitted. In the case of an advance online publication, "advance online publication" is inserted in place of the missing data.

If the journal article has an article number instead of a page range, the word "Article" and then the article number is inserted instead of the page range.

Conference proceedings are usually either published as a journal article or as a chapter in an edited book, with the journal or book consisting of all the proceedings from the conference.

**Journal articles:** Last name, initials. (Year). Title: Subtitle. *Name of journal, volume*(number or issue), first page of article-last page of article. DOI or URL [depending on availability and accessibility].

**Newspaper articles:** Last name, initials. (year, month day). Title: subtitle. *Newspaper*, first page of article-last page of article. DOI (if available) or URL [depending on availability and accessibility].

#### 2.2.5 Online Sources in APA

The procedure for citing an online source (websites and PDF files that are not eBooks) is based on the same principle as for citing electronic versions of other types of documents. In addition, the following rules apply:

- The date refers to the last update. If a full date of publication is stated, this must be given in full, including the day, month and year.
- In addition, the name of the website or institution must be given.
- If no author is given, the publishing institution (to be found in the imprint) is to be cited as the author. The name of the website is omitted in these cases if it is identical to the named institution. If the name of the publishing institution is not known either, the name of the website is given as author.
- The retrieval date is not added.¹⁰
- If several subpages are cited from an Internet site, a separate entry should be created for each.
- In the case of a general reference to an Internet site, no reference to the source should be made either in the text or in the reference list. Instead, the name is mentioned in the text and the internet address is included in brackets (see example at the end of chapter 2.1.3).
- In the case of a one-time session (e.g., statistical data queries on Destatis), the URL to the login or main page should be given (not a complete link to the data query, as this is not permanently valid). The title must indicate which data was queried.
- For webpages with statistical databases (e.g. Statista), the original source must be noted. This is to be named as author. In addition, it should be checked whether the data is publicly available or password-protected content. For the latter, the URL to the login or main page should be given (not a full link to the data query).

**Online source with author:** Last name, initials. (year, month day). Title: Subtitle. Institution or website. DOI [if available] or URL

**Online source with institution as author or name of website:** Institution or website. (year, month day). Title: subtitle. Website (if not already named or identical to Institution). DOI [if available] or URL

Dates are the date of release or the most recent update. If there is no date, type n.d.

An audiobook is referenced in the same way as a print book, so you do not need to indicate that it is an electronic version. This is not the case if:

- the content of the audiobook is different from the print version (for example, an abridged version)
- you have a reason to indicate that it is an audiobook (for example, if you are studying the impact of the narration on the listener)
- you have cited the audiobook in your text with a timestamp (see section 2.1.1)

**Audiobook = Print book:** Last name, initials. (year). *Title: Subtitle*. Publisher.

**Audiobook ≠ Print book or audiobook quoted in text:** Last name, initials. (year). *Title: Subtitle* [audiobook]. Publisher.

**Footnotes:**

¹ Indicating page numbers in in-text citations for both quotations and paraphrases makes it easier to follow citations. At this point the IU regulation is stricter than the APA regulation and requires indicating a page number.

² The regulations for the use of figures and tables in the citation guidelines differ from the APA standard. The deviation is intended to simplify usage, especially when using the literature management software.

³ In general, it is recommended not to use screenshots of figures and tables, but to reproduce them.

⁴ This means that you should only capitalize the first word of a title or subtitle and proper nouns.

⁵ A classification as "Goethe, J. W. von", alphabetically under "G", is also possible, if you use e.g. Citavi or prefer this variant. It is important that you proceed uniformly.

⁶ A DOI (digital object identifier) allows a unique and permanent identification of digital sources, because it does not change.

⁷ Fictive example.

⁸ As a general rule, comments from other previous papers are not worth citing. An exception may exist, for example, with regard to the results of your own empirical study.

⁹ If you use Zotero, enter "Advance online publication " in the page number field. The comma after the journal title has no influence on the evaluation of your scientific work.

¹⁰ This is a deviation from the APA regulation which in a few cases stipulates the inclusion of the retrieval date.
