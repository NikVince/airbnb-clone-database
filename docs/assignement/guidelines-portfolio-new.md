## 1. DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVE OF A PORTFOLIO

The academic assessment "Portfolio" is mainly a practical exercise that is designed and carried out individually. Nonetheless, this process is supervised by the responsible tutor.

In contrast to a written project report, this examination combines the practical implementation and development of a product with digital documentations as part of a portfolio.

The assessment corresponds to a reflection portfolio. The individual learning and examination process is recorded and accompanied in a reflective manner. Finally, there is the opportunity to use the portfolio within the framework of a presentation or career portfolio for application and "self-marketing".

The result of a portfolio always consists of a "**product**" in the actual or figurative sense. Depending on the module/course's specifications, this can consist of a software solution, a design, an installation, a process, a business plan or similar project.

The portfolio consists of three phases, which are intended to illustrate the individual work or development steps and the adopted approach. The learning progress or increase in competence achieved in this multi-phase process is documented using three portfolio phases within a portfolio software called "PebblePad". The three phases mentioned are the "conception phase", the "development/reflection phase" and the "finalization phase". These are explained in more detail in Chapter 2. The course-specific requirements of the respective phases and portfolio pages form parts of the final portfolio are described in more detail in the assignments.

The final portfolio is thus the product of the entire editing process with its intermediate steps including the final product, a reflection of the approach, and methodology within the framework of a two-page abstract.

**Depending on the module or course, it may be part of the portfolio to procure the resources required for implementation.** These can consist of data, applications, technical equipment, software, various tools, etc. Further information on this topic can be found in the assignments and, if applicable, in the corresponding course on "myCampus".

**Important:** The selection, parameterization, and use of programs (software, tools, apps, etc.) are also an integral part of the portfolio for conceptual topics and must be documented accordingly.

The portfolio is submitted via the "PebblePad" tool. For registration, use, and the individual functions of "PebblePad", there is a separate user guide on "myCampus". If you have any further questions regarding your exam performance or "PebblePad", please contact the exam office via mail.

## 2. PHASES OF A PORTFOLIO

In order to develop the portfolio, a multi-step procedure is necessary. In the final portfolio, these steps are reflected in various portfolio pages, which cover the phases described below. The focus here, is on the strict adherence to these 3 phases, in the order given, and the adequate processing of the respective intermediate steps.

**Important:** The correct adherence to the given order is part of the examination. If the outlined order is not adhered to, the test will be considered as failed.

**Please note:** In the finalization phase (phase 3) all three portfolio parts have to be uploaded again. In the meantime, the results of phase 1 and phase 2 may be explicitly revised again in consideration of the feedback. However, the respective final results from phase 1 and phase 2 must be saved separately.

In addition, the orientation towards the central guiding questions should serve as further assistance with the development of the portfolio. The portfolio is then created by working through the individual phases.

### 2.1. Conception phase

In this phase, the **concept or core idea** should be introduced contextually with a short description of the content and the goal(s) as well as the initial motivation.

The procedure should also be described.

The conception phase should be based on the following **key questions**:

- What is the aim of my work?
- What are my ideas? Testing ideas for sustainability: What are positives and negatives?
- What is the concept of my work?
- How do I plan to proceed?
- Which methodology/which tool did I choose and why?

The conception phase concludes with the submission of a first portfolio page in PebblePad in the following form:

- A brief explanation of the concept in the form of a text of maximum half a DIN A4 page must be included.
- Depending on the course, first sketches/drafts/diagrams have to be created and inserted according to the formalities and parameters defined in the assignments.

**Important:** This part must be submitted before the next steps, the "Development phase/Reflection phase" and the "Finalization phase", can be processed. Information on the next steps and phases can be found in chapters 2.2 and 2.3. After submission, the tutor will reply with a feedback which will include recommendation(s). **It is recommended further processing of the next phase is continued only after the feedback has been given.** Whilst proceeding further, the recommended corrections within the scope of the feedback should be taken into consideration as much as possible. Depending on the scope and number of submitted works, feedback can take up to seven days.

The conception phase is included in the final grade, see Chapter 3 Evaluation criteria. **At the final submission (of phase 3), the results from phase 1 must also be uploaded again.**

### 2.2. Development phase/reflection phase

Implementation of your basic ideas takes place in this phase. Depending on the scope, several intermediate steps may be necessary.

During the development and reflection phase, the following factors should be taken into account:

- Realization of the project/task
- Orientation to the goals/the project plan
- Consideration of available resources (e.g. time, technology, etc.)
- Identifying potential problems, risks and opportunities for improvement
- Monitoring status and progress

This phase concludes with the submission of a portfolio page in the following form:

- A short written explanation of the implementation in the form of a text of maximum half a DIN A4 page must be included.
- The creation of a digital design/intermediate step should be enclosed according to the formalities and parameters defined in the assignments.

**Important:** This part must be submitted (uploaded and saved) before the "Finalization Phase" can be processed. After submission, the tutor will give some minor feedback. It is recommended further processing of the next phase is continued only after the feedback has been given. The recommended corrections within the scope of the feedback should be taken into consideration as much as possible. Depending on the scope and number of submitted works, feedback can take up to seven days.

This phase is included in the final mark, see Chapter 3 Evaluation criteria. **At the final submission (of phase 3), the results from phase 2 must also be uploaded again.**

### 2.3. Finalization phase

In the "Finalization phase", the **final product and/or a final version of the portfolio** are developed and submitted. Furthermore, a two-page **abstract** must be included in the final concept as well as a reflection on the implementation and its results, for example based on the following guidelines:

- Short presentation of the **objectives**/the idea/the concept/the methodology
- Sources/**Resources**/Software/Breakdown of implementation, etc.
- From the concept idea to implementation and result(s): What **result** have I achieved? Does the result correspond to the goal of the work? If not, why not?
- If necessary, **reflection** on your performance, e.g.: What conclusions can I draw from the editing process?

This phase concludes with the development of a third, final portfolio part with the following content:

- An abstract in PDF format. Further specifications and formalities are defined in the assignments.
- In addition, the final product should be created and inserted according to the formalities and parameters defined in the assignments.
- resubmission of results from phase 1
- resubmission of results from phase 2
- Optional: Upload a zip folder with additional resources. Further details can be found in the assignments.

**Important:** Within six weeks following the submission of the third portfolio page, the tutor submits the final feedback which includes evaluation and scoring. The feedback and the fulfilment of the evaluation criteria can be found in the final portfolio in "Atlas". The grade will be visible in your examination results. If you have any questions about your exam performance, please contact the exam office via mail.
