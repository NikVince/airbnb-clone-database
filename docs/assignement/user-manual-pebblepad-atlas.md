## 1. TERMINOLOGY

The Pebble+ ePortfolio system is a personal learning and examination system, which consists of two main components: "Atlas" and "PebblePad".

### 1.1. Atlas - Assessment Space

"Atlas" is the institutional audit component. This is where you register (the first time you click) to edit your portfolio in PebblePad. Afterwards, you can search for relevant information pertaining to the examination via "Atlas", such as the tutor's feedback and the evaluation of the submitted portfolio.

### 1.2. PebblePad - Portfolio Templates

After registration via "Atlas", the different templates for the portfolio parts will be available in "PebblePad". You can alter, edit, save, and submit these templates for evaluation.

---

## 2. USE OF PEBBLEPAD

### Technical requirements:

- always open PebblePad / Atlas via the courses on MyCampus, not externally
- use Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome
- try/use different devices and/or Webbrowser
- check your Cookie- and Cache settings in your browser, make sure you disable Pop-Up-Blockers
- keep your browser updated

In the course, always click on the individual visible areas first, then the relevant sub-areas will open:

**Proceed in the following way:**

```
ATLAS
  ↓

  ↓ edit & submit for evaluation

```

### 2.1. Affidavit

Before you can register for "PebblePad", you must submit your affidavit electronically.

Go to the "myCampus" course and click on "Affidavit".

Read the affidavit carefully and confirm it by clicking "I agree!".

#### 2.2. Declaration of consent to data protection

This section is NOT included in every course and is specifically tailored to the assignment. Please note that in some courses, in addition to the affidavit, the "Declaration of consent to data protection" must also be completed in order to access all areas of the course. If this is available in your course, you will find it in a separate section of the course. If you do not find this, you do not need to complete anything else.

The button on the left-hand side with the course name can be used to navigate back to the course.

### 2.2. PebblePad registration

In "myCampus" course click on the blue button **"Atlas - Assessment Space"** and you will be registered for "PebblePad".

The following page will open in a new tab, where you can view the feedback and evaluation anytime.

Now go back to the previous tab (MyCampus course), the newly opened Tab (Atlas Workspace) can be closed.

Using the button on the left you can get back to your course.

### 2.3. PebblePad - Portfolio Templates

To start editing the portfolio, click on the green button: **"PebblePad - Portfolio Templates"**.

This will open the homepage of your personal "PebblePad" area in a new tab.

In this overview, you will find the templates under **"Resources"** in the upper left-hand side of the page. These are required for the portfolio. Under "Custom templates", only the correct templates are available.

To return to this page later, click on the button at the top:

> Here you will find short video tutorials, help, hints and tips on how to use PebblePad!

The available templates correspond to the three phases of the portfolio in a subsequent order.

Click on the respective template to open it for editing.

Upon opening of a template, please "name" your file correctly. Fill in the "Save as..." field as follows:

**Last name_First name_Matriculation number_course_task topic_phase X**

Example: Mustermann_Max_123456_Test_Albumcover_Phase 1.

Please use the button **"Save"**, to save the file.

**Note:** This is only a temporary storage. This means that your work will NOT BE automatically submitted for assessment.

By pressing the **"Preview"** button, your saved filed will be displayed in the page layout.

---

## 3. EDIT TEMPLATES

The actual processing of the tasks takes place outside of "PebblePad". Depending on the course, you will be required to do sketches, create files in programs, compose texts, etc.

### 3.1. Insert media

To insert the drafts/intermediate steps/end results (media) in the three phases, click in the blue field: **"Open asset store."**

You can select one of the previously attached files (assets) or add a new file via **"Upload new"**. ("Drag & drop" or "choose a file")

**Important:** After uploading, you must confirm your upload.

Once you have saved the file, it is stored in the personal area under "Assets". You may edit it anytime unless you have already submitted it for evaluation.

If you upload a new file via **"Choose a file"**, it then selects your desired upload with a checkmark. This file must then be confirmed using the **"Done"** button.

The Justification window can be skipped with **"Save"**

You should then see that your submission has been added:

If you see the **1** and the **document icon** next to the "Add" field, everything has worked.

Please keep in mind, that your uploaded file can only be inserted inside the template, if the upload is completed.

#### Save your Templates

Before you upload more files into your template, you should save. Close your template and make sure, that with reopening the template all your files will be displayed correctly. If a file is missing after you have closed the template, you need to reupload the files as described in the previous steps and save again.

**In accordance with exam law, your submission may not be altered after you have submitted your template. Therefore, it is important to make sure every file is uploaded correctly into the template.**

### 3.2. Add zip folder

**Include a zip folder in the submission:**

In phase 3, you may need to submit used resources and created files that have been saved in a specially created zip folder.

This works via the **"Resources"** field.

After that, click to select the corresponding zip folder to be loaded into the delivery field and click **"Done"**.

Another sidebar opens to save the zip folder to be loaded into the template by clicking on **"Save"**. The text field for "Add a justification" can be ignored.

**Attention:** You haven't completed implementing the zip-folder into your template.

Please keep in mind, that your zip-folder can only be implemented into the template if your upload is completed.

#### Check zip folder

After you have successfully saved your zip folder in the template, another button appears next to the **"+ Add..."** button. This button shows you the number of your uploaded files in this field. With a click on this button the sidebar in the template opens again with some useful information (**"CAPABILITY INFO"**). Here you can check your saved zip folder again before the final submission:

1. You can attach additional files directly via the button **"+ Add evidence"** (leads back to the previous view, see above).
2. You can delete the attached zip-folder by clicking on **"Remove evidence"**.
3. By setting the checkmark at **"This evidence is complete"** you can display in the portfolio template that the field has been filled in completely.

#### Save your Templates

Before you upload more files into your template, you should save. Close your template and make sure, that with reopening the template all your files will be displayed correctly. If a file is missing after you have closed the template, you need to reupload the files as described in the previous steps and save again.

**In accordance with exam law, your submission may not be altered after you have submitted your template. Therefore, it is important to make sure every file is uploaded correctly into the template.**

## 4. SUBMIT FOR EVALUATION

If a phase of your portfolio is finished and you would like to submit it for evaluation, follow this path:

**Attention:** Please note that once you have submitted a part for evaluation, changes to the said phase are no longer possible.

1. Process and check all fields. Please ensure that you have selected the correct files for any submission.
2. Go to **"I want to..."** and then **"Share"**
3. Now, select **"With ATLAS"** as shown below.
4. Check all data again and agree to the terms of use. Only then you may click on **"Share asset."**

**Once you have submitted a part for evaluation, you can no longer make changes to it.**

---

## 5. CHECK YOUR SUBMISSIONS

Click on **"Assets"**:

Here you can find all your templates. Search for your desired template and make sure, that the **"Share"-symbol** is visible. If the symbol isn't faded out, you have successfully submitted your template and shared it to Atlas.

If you click on the symbol, a sidebar opens, which shows you the information inside which phase and in which workspace you shared your template into. Here you can see in detail, if sharing your template with Atlas was successful.
