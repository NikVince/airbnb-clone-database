# Airbnb Database Implementation

**Course:** Build a Data Mart in SQL (DLBDSPBDM01)  
**Phase:** 2 - Database Implementation  
**Student:** Nikolas Daniel Vincenti  
**Date:** 15/10/2025  

## Overview

This directory contains the complete SQL implementation of the Airbnb database designed in Phase 2. The database includes 27 entities with comprehensive relationships, constraints, and sample data.

## Database Structure

### Entity Count
- **Total Entities:** 27
- **Triple Relationships:** 3
- **Recursive Relationships:** 1
- **Foreign Key Relationships:** 45+
- **Constraints:** 89+ (CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)

### Key Features
- **Role-Based Architecture:** Separate guest and host profiles
- **Multi-Role Support:** Users can be both guests and hosts
- **Complete Normalization:** All tables in 3NF/BCNF
- **Comprehensive Constraints:** Business rules enforced at database level
- **Performance Optimized:** Strategic indexing for common queries

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- DBeaver (recommended) or MySQL Workbench
- Command line access to MySQL

### RECOMMENDED: Single-Step Installation Process

**Complete Installation**
```bash
# Connect to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

# Run the complete installation script (includes database creation and sample data)
source /path/to/Vincenti-Nikolas_9211929_DLBDSPBDM01_P2_S_CompleteInstallation.sql
```

This approach includes:
- ✅ Database creation with all 27 tables
- ✅ Proper constraints and indexes
- ✅ Bulletproof sample data (no constraint violations)
- ✅ All foreign key relationships working
- ✅ Complete data for presentation queries

### Alternative: Presentation Queries

For testing and presentation purposes:

```bash
# Run presentation queries to demonstrate database functionality
source /path/to/Vincenti-Nikolas_9211929_DLBDSPBDM01_P2_S_PresentationQueries.sql
```

### DBeaver Installation (Recommended)

1. **Open DBeaver** and connect to your MySQL server
2. **File → Open File** → Select `Vincenti-Nikolas_9211929_DLBDSPBDM01_P2_S_CompleteInstallation.sql`
3. **Execute the entire script** (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+Enter)
4. **Verify installation** by checking the results panel
5. **Optional:** Run presentation queries for testing

## ⚠️ Important Installation Notes

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH:** Use the submitted installation script for a complete, error-free installation.

### Known Issues Fixed

The original scripts had constraint conflicts that have been resolved:

1. **CHECK Constraint Conflicts:** Removed problematic CHECK constraints that conflicted with FOREIGN KEY constraints in:
   - `reviews` table (`chk_reviews_different_users`)
   - `conversations` table (`chk_conversations_different_participants`)

2. **DELIMITER Syntax Issues:** Removed DELIMITER statements that caused parsing errors in DBeaver

3. **Trigger Compatibility:** Removed trigger definitions that caused syntax errors

### Business Rules Enforcement

Business rules that were previously enforced via CHECK constraints are now enforced at the application level:
- Users cannot review themselves
- Conversation participants must be different users
- All other business rules remain enforced via appropriate constraints

## Database Schema

### Core Domains

1. **User Management Domain**
   - `users` - Base user table with role tracking
   - `guest_profiles` - Guest-specific attributes
   - `host_profiles` - Host-specific attributes
   - `user_profiles` - General user profiles
   - `user_verification` - Identity verification
   - `user_preferences` - User settings

2. **Property Management Domain**
   - `properties` - Property listings
   - `property_types` - Property categories
   - `property_amenities` - Available amenities
   - `property_amenity_links` - Property-amenity relationships
   - `property_photos` - Property images
   - `property_pricing` - Pricing rules

3. **Location Domain**
   - `addresses` - Property addresses
   - `cities` - City information
   - `countries` - Country data

4. **Booking System Domain**
   - `bookings` - Reservation records
   - `booking_status` - Status definitions
   - `booking_modifications` - Change tracking

5. **Financial Domain**
   - `payments` - Payment transactions
   - `payment_methods` - Payment options
   - `payouts` - Host payouts

6. **Review System Domain**
   - `reviews` - User reviews
   - `review_categories` - Review criteria
   - `review_ratings` - Detailed ratings

7. **Communication Domain**
   - `conversations` - Message threads
   - `messages` - Individual messages

8. **System Domain**
   - `notifications` - System notifications

### Triple Relationships

1. **Property-Booking-Pricing** (`property_booking_pricing`)
   - Links properties to bookings with applied pricing rules

2. **User-Booking-Review** (`user_booking_review`)
   - Tracks user interactions with bookings and reviews

3. **Booking-Payment-Payout** (`booking_payment_payout`)
   - Complete financial transaction chain

### Recursive Relationship

- **User Self-Referencing:** Users can book other users' properties
- Implemented through the booking system connecting guests to hosts

## Sample Data

The database includes realistic sample data:
- **25+ countries** with major cities
- **25+ users** with guest and host profiles
- **20+ properties** with amenities and photos
- **20+ bookings** with complete transaction flow
- **20+ reviews** with detailed ratings
- **20+ messages** in conversation threads

## Test Queries

The test queries demonstrate:
- User role management and verification
- Property listings with amenities
- Complete booking and payment flow
- Review system with ratings
- Geographic distribution analysis
- Host performance metrics
- Communication system
- Financial transaction tracking
- Triple relationship functionality
- Recursive relationship demonstration

## Performance Features

### Indexes
- **Primary Key Indexes:** All tables have primary key indexes
- **Foreign Key Indexes:** All foreign keys are indexed
- **Composite Indexes:** Multi-column indexes for common queries
- **Covering Indexes:** Indexes that cover frequently accessed columns

### Constraints
- **Entity Integrity:** Primary keys and NOT NULL constraints
- **Referential Integrity:** Foreign key constraints with CASCADE/RESTRICT
- **Domain Integrity:** CHECK constraints for business rules
- **Unique Constraints:** Natural keys and business rules

## Business Rules Implemented

### User Management
- Users can have multiple roles (guest, host, admin)
- Guest profiles created automatically on first booking
- Host profiles created when user applies to become host
- Role flags must be consistent with profile existence

### Property Management
- Properties must have at least one photo
- Pricing rules must have valid date ranges
- Amenities linked through many-to-many relationships

### Booking System
- Check-out date must be after check-in date
- Guest count cannot exceed property capacity
- Bookings cannot be made for past dates

### Financial System
- Payments must be positive amounts
- Payouts processed 24 hours after check-in
- Transaction chain status tracked through triple relationship

### Review System
- Reviews can only be written after stay completion
- Users cannot review themselves
- Ratings must be between 1 and 5

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Foreign Key Constraint Violations**
   - Ensure sample data is inserted in correct order
   - Check that referenced records exist before inserting

2. **Check Constraint Violations**
   - Verify data meets business rule requirements
   - Check date formats and ranges

3. **Unique Constraint Violations**
   - Ensure email addresses and phone numbers are unique
   - Check for duplicate entries

### Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check table counts
SELECT 
    TABLE_NAME,
    TABLE_ROWS
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'airbnb_database'
ORDER BY TABLE_ROWS DESC;

-- Check foreign key relationships
SELECT 
    CONSTRAINT_NAME,
    TABLE_NAME,
    COLUMN_NAME,
    REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME,
    REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME
FROM information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'airbnb_database'
AND REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME IS NOT NULL;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run Installation Scripts:** Execute all SQL files in order
2. **Verify Data:** Check that all tables have expected row counts
3. **Test Queries:** Run test queries to verify functionality
4. **Take Screenshots:** Capture results for presentation
5. **Document Results:** Prepare presentation materials

## Support
